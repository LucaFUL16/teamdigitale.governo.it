Juliette Mattioli began her career as a high school teacher in Mathematics in 1982. After ten years, she joined Thomson-CSF research team, where she stayed from 1993 to 2001 as a Research Engineer. She obtained her Ph.D in Applied Mathematics in 1993 from University of Paris IX Dauphine, entitled « Problèmes Inverses et Relations Différentielles en Morphologie Mathématique » (Relationships and Differential Inverse Problems in Mathematical Morphology). Her PhD was mainly dedicated to the design of an image pattern matching system using mathematical morphology and neural networks based on shape transformations which are invariant to translation, rotation or factor scale. Her thesis ended up with the 1993 book "Morphologie Mathématique" (Masson, Ecole des Mines) she wrote with Michel Schmitt.

From October 1993 to January 1996, she was a research engineer in charge of a French MoD study which provided algorithms for non-cooperative target detection without a priori knowledge. The innovative approach was based of coupling mathematical morphology operators with (max,+) algebra (a variation of lattice theory). Then, she became head of research labs. in Thales Research and Technology in 2001 dedicated to AI decision support, Operations Research, Semantic Fusion and Mining. She was appointed Strategy & Innovation Manager at Thales Technical Directorate in 2010. In 2012, she became senior expert for the Thales Group on Optimization, Decision and Information Fusion including data analytics. In 2017 she was appointed AI Senior Expert. Juliette Mattioli has published a number of papers and 7 patents. She has led many R&D projects for Thales Programs and National and European Projects (FP6, FP7, H2020).
