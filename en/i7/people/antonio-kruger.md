Antonio Krüger received a diploma in computer science and economics at Saarland University in 1995. Afterwards he joined the Cognitive Science Graduate Programme of the same University and finished it with a doctoral degree in 1999. His doctoral thesis was on the & Automated Abstraction of 3D-Graphics&quot;.He was early involved in several Artificial Intelligence projects at the German Research Centre for AI (DFKI GmbH), and later from 1999-2003 at the Intelligent Systems Lab of Saarland University as a Senior Researcher. In 2000 he co-founded the University spin-off Eyeled GmbH, a company focusing on mobile computing solutions. Within the company he is responsible for the technology transfer of university research.
From 2004 to 2009 he was an associate professor for Geoinformatics and Computer Science at Münster University, Germany. From 2005 to 2009 he was the managing director of the institute for Geoinformatics at the same University.
Since 2009 Antonio Krüger is a full professor for Computer Science at Saarland University. At the same time he has been appointed as the Scientific Director of the Innovative Retail Laboratory at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Saarbrücken, Germany.
Antonio's main research areas are Intelligent User Interfaces and mobile and ubiquitous context-aware Systems. He worked on the automatic generation of graphics for technical documentations, intelligent navigation systems and personalized media generation. In this context he looked at generation processes that take into account both the limited technical resources of output devices and the limited cognitive resources of the users. More recent examples of his research come from the domain of mobile and ubiquitous computing. Here, Antonio is involved in projects on interactive display networks, mobile augmented reality and interactive surface computing.
Antonio is co-organising the annual Smart-Graphics Symposium and served on various program committees in the field of intelligent mobile systems, e.g. Intelligent User Interfaces, User Modeling, Ubicomp, Mobisys, and Pervasive Computing.
