Ted spent most of his pre-Facebook career as a Washington DC lawyer, including as a law clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia; as a litigation partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP; and in the administration of President George W. Bush (as a deputy assistant in the White House, and later as chief of staff at the Justice Department under Attorney General Gonzales). At other points in his career, Ted served as General Counsel of ESL Investments, Inc., as General Counsel of AOL Time Warner Europe, and as a member of the board of AutoZone, Inc.
